# nand2tetris
The Elements of Computing Systems, also known as “Nand2Tetris” is an ambitious course / project series/ book attempting to give you a cohesive understanding of how everything in a computer works. Each chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from writing elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the way to an application the size of a Tetris game.

## Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates

Implementation of following gates using only Nand Gate:-
Not, An, Or, Xor,Mux (Multiplexer), DMux (DeMultiplexer)
Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way,


## Project 2: Combinational Chips or Boolean arithmetic

This project contains building of Half Adder, Full Adder, 16 bit Adder, 16-bit incrementer
and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU, the centerpiece of CPU).The Logic gates built in first project 
becomes the base for implementation of this project
